## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of ObjectView up and running on your desktop computer. 
### Prerequisites
You will need a good modern desktop browser like Chrome, FireFox or Safari.
1. Download the ZIP to your computer. 
2. Unzip the contents and open the index.html file in your desktop browser.


The top navigation bar has two buttons for loading files, called "NFO" & "Browse". To open and view a PC3 or Forte file, select the "Browse button".

#### What is a NFO file?
NFO files are exported currently only from the PC3 series. 

NFO files can export all the controller information for Programs and Effects Chains from "Storage Mode". A NFO file is best thought of as Kurzweils fancy name for a CSV file, which you would commonly use in software like Microsoft EXCEL. It is simply a text file with a "|" delimiter. It is very handy 



#### Open a PC3/Forte file
Click the Browse button.
Find the file you would like to open and view.
Press ok.
