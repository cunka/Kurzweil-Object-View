# Kurzweil Object View
Open and view the objects within your PC3/K/A. Should work on Forte files as well. (Not fully tested, but welcome anyone who does field testing with it.)  You can make a list of items of all the objects, either as a Excel, XML, JSON, CSV and SQL.  Has a handy feature where it creates a hash of each object. This allows you to compare and find duplicate objects (like effects chains, algorithms) when you check with software like Excel.
